Why do I like Jackson Pollock's works?


Some think that they are either erratic, nonsensical, distasteful, or any combination of the three. Honestly though, his works look as if a child got left alone in a room with a bucket full of paint. No talent. Right? Some tend to disagree and I may be one of them.

The strangeness will wear off and I think we will discover the deeper meanings in modern art...

I remember the first time that my eyes beheld Autumn Rhythm{% tooltip "Number 30" %}. My first reaction was “What the&mdash;Why?”. But it's peculiar features drew me in like the Death Star’s tractor beam. Novelty. Given the title, to me it feels like a visual representation of Jazz music. The tan string base in the background, plucking away while the dark brown saxophone swirls around the white blotches of drumming. Or it's just a squashed s'more. Take your pick.

In my philosophy course we have been discussing this idea of luck. We discussed ways to mitigate the calamity that may befall us as a result of bad luck. Now I use the word mitigate deliberately. In class some would frame the questions as how can one control luck. I found this irksome. I am quite against the idea of controlling luck as that seems to undermine luck’s meaning to begin with. I made sure to correct this semantic sin{% tooltip &#x1f601; %}. But then along came Pollock. 

Abstract expressionism materialized out of the dissipating mushroom cloud in the wake of a war torn world. It's no doubt that the adoption of this singular artistic style was influenced by the Second World War. The leading figure in the movement, Jackson Pollock, is known for his uncommon technique of drip painting(fn: Shown above). Pollock would lay out a huge canvas on the floor of a barn—‘dancing’ around as he spilled, splashed, sprinkled, splattered onto it. The moment the paint escapes the brush its destination is left to chance. Pollock seems to “control” luck. To utilize it for his own advantage. Sure, he dictates the general direction but leaves it up to gravity and momentum to bring the oily blob to rest on the canvas—each drip filled with mystery, suspense and emotion. Controlling luck doesn’t have to mean thwarting the fall of water from the sky when you're out and about without  jacket. Or preventing a tire from suddenly and inexplicably going flat on you. Pollock marginalizes (fn: e.g. controls) luck by entreating its participate in the painting of his piece.
