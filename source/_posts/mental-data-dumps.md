## What is this? Why is this here? And why are you here reading it?

Well I can’t answer for you because putting words into people’s mouth runs the risk of causing suffocation. But I _can_ tell you what it is you are reading and why it’s sitting out here on what I call a digitally distributed platform. Why? Because I love alliteration. It tickles me as I hope to tickle you, mentally of course. Look, I’d like to call myself a philosopher, psychologist, and/or sociologist, but, beyond the gen psych course that I took years ago, I haven’t had any "formal training". If you are like me you probably have questions popping into your head like, “What does it take to be worthy of the title a ‘philosopher’ or ‘psychologist’”. These are good questions that I may explore in the future (But don’t hesitate to comment your thoughts on the matter).

But for now what I can definitively say is that I am a thinker. A polymath. A neophiliac. A learner. A pursuer. A visionary. Thus, in writing this blog I seek to pour out the contents of my highly active brain with the hopes to inspire and challenge the minds of those who gaze upon these mental data dumps of mine.
